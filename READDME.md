# Power BI Healthcare Analytics Case Study

## Course Overview

In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. This Power BI case study will guide you through analyzing healthcare data to uncover insights into hospital efficiency. You'll work with a real-world dataset provided for a fictional consulting company called **HealthStat**. By the end of this project, you'll be able to present actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Project Objectives

1. **Explore Healthcare Data**  
   - Analyze data related to patient care, focusing on length of stay (LOS) and healthcare costs.
   - Investigate the factors that impact these attributes across different hospitals.

2. **Leverage DAX for Data Analysis**  
   - Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create measures, calculated columns, and KPIs.
   - Analyze trends, summarize data, and extract key insights about patient care and hospital efficiency.

3. **Build a Power BI Dashboard**  
   - Create a comprehensive healthcare dashboard for HealthStat.
   - Use visualizations to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders, highlighting key insights into factors impacting LOS and costs.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in:
- Importing, cleaning, and transforming data in Power BI.
- Applying DAX functions to perform advanced calculations.
- Building interactive reports and dashboards in Power BI tailored to healthcare analytics.
- Understanding and visualizing healthcare data to reveal efficiency opportunities.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Power BI (data import, basic visualizations)
- Familiarity with DAX for calculated measures and columns
- A foundational understanding of healthcare KPIs such as length of stay (LOS) and patient cost metrics

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Import and Exploration
- Import the provided healthcare dataset into Power BI.
- Review the dataset structure, identifying key fields related to patient care, costs, and hospital attributes.

### Step 2: Data Transformation and Cleaning
- Perform data cleaning steps to prepare the data for analysis.
- Use Power Query to handle missing data, filter outliers, and format columns as needed.

### Step 3: DAX Measures and Calculations
- Create DAX measures to calculate key metrics, such as average LOS, total costs, and efficiency ratios.
- Use calculated columns to segment data and categorize hospitals based on performance.

### Step 4: Build Insights with Visualizations
- Design visualizations to display trends, comparisons, and outliers in patient care metrics.
- Use charts, tables, and filters to make insights interactive and accessible.

### Step 5: Dashboard Design
- Compile insights into a cohesive, user-friendly dashboard.
- Ensure that the dashboard clearly communicates key findings to the HealthStat team, using slicers and tooltips for enhanced interactivity.

## Sample Visualizations

- **Length of Stay Analysis**: A bar chart showing LOS across hospitals with drill-down capabilities.
- **Cost Breakdown**: A treemap or pie chart to visualize different cost factors.
- **Efficiency Dashboard**: KPIs for top-performing hospitals and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

This case study provides a comprehensive look into healthcare data analysis using Power BI. By completing it, you'll have sharpened your skills in data manipulation, DAX, and dashboard designâ€”all crucial tools for healthcare analytics.
